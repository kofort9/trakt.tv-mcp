# Pre-commit Checks

Before creating a git commit, YOU MUST run the following command to ensure code quality and prevent CI failures:

```bash
npm run verify
```

This command runs:
1. Formatting (`npm run format`)
2. Build (`npm run build`)
3. Linting (`npm run lint`)
4. Tests (`npm test`)

If any of these steps fail, fix the issues BEFORE committing. Do not commit broken code or code that fails linting/formatting.
